Max Score: 50

BACK TO ASSIGNMENT
Use KNearestNeighbourRegressor to Predict Price of House.

Here is the dataset https://github.com/edyoda/data-science-complete-tutorial/blob/master/Data/house_rental_data.csv.txt



Use pandas to get some insights into the data (10 marks)
Show some interesting visualization of the data (10 marks)
Manage data for training & testing (20)
Finding a better value of k (10)



2.Again, on the same dataset. Cluster similar houses together. Here is the dataset https://github.com/edyoda/data-science-complete-tutorial/blob/master/Data/house_rental_data.csv.txt



Data cleaning & getting rid of irrelevant information before clustering
Finding the optimal value of k
Storing cluster to which the house belongs along with the data
